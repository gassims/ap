# Hello, world!

This is my CS50's site! This site will be for assignments, research, and work in the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science 2020 course. "CS50 is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming." (Milan, David J. “CS50.” CS50, 2020, www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science.)
# I decided to take this course to reinforce my understanding of the fundamental concepts in CS before I graduate from college with a degree in Information Technology. It's always nice to revise the basics and they come in handy when one is overwhelmed with extra work. Furthermore, I decided to make this a helpful site for others.
